        <img src = "images/pupusas1.jpg" class = "center">
        <p>What are they? Pronounced POO-POO-SAHS, my explanation of Pupusas are as follows: (Pardon my language) F***ING DELICIOUS!!!</p>
        <p>Wikipedia defines them as: thick griddle cakes or flatbreads made with cornmeal or rice flour. It is usually stuffed with 1 or more ingrediants which may include cheese, certain meats, squash, or refried beans.</p>

            <h2>History of Pupusas</h2>
            <img src = "images/historypup.png" class = "center">
            <p>Pupusas originated from El Salvador. They have been linked to the Pipil tribes who inhabited territory in El Salvador. Pupusas are the national dish of El Salvador and there is a specific day dedecated to them. There is a controversy about where pupusas actually originated from as Honduras claims their origin as well but the only thing that matters is that these beautiful babies exist!<!--CAN I PUT EMOJIS?--> </p>

        <h2>My Pupusa Story</h2>
        <img src = "images/IMG_0528.jpeg" class = "center">
        <p>My personal relationship with pupusas began when I met my amazing fiancé. She is from LA, California &amp; her parents are from El Salvador &amp; Guatemala. Her mom makes BOMB pupusas &amp; learning from her culture &amp; heritage inspired me to make pupusas on my own! I encourage you to as well! Make this a staple in your household &amp; you will NOT be disappointed dude.</p>

        <h2>How To Eat Pupusas?</h2>
        <img src = "images/pupcurtysalsa.jpg" class = "center">
        <p>Pupusas are usually eaten by hand &amp; are accompanied with salsa &amp; or curtido. Curtido (cour-tee-doh) is a Hispanic version of "coleslaw". For the inside there is always cheese but can be accompanied with beans, squash, or chicharrón as well. Chicharrón (chee-cha-rrohn) is a type of pork. For authentic pupusas a special quesillo type of cheese or cheese infused with loroco (a type of plant) can be used but I use shredded mozzarella.</p>
    
        <h2>How To Make Pupusas!</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe to make basic cheese pupusas. You can always mix it up &amp; add whatever you want! Just make sure they are really cheesy or they won't be as good!</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <p>4 CUPS MASA HARINA (I use MASECA: it is masa flour &amp; can be found in the flour section of Walmart!)</p>
        <p>1 TEASPOON SALT</p>
        <p>3 CUPS COLD WATER</p>
        <p>1 CUP GRATED MOZZERELLA CHEESE</p>
        <P>1 TABLESPOON VEGETABLE OIL FOR FRYING</P>
        <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the masa harina &amp; salt, then add the water. Use your hands to mix until the dough comes together with a clay-like texture. (I also use a stand mixer if I'm being lazy, you just have to make sure the texture is clay like, it will be sticky but the next step helps with that!</p>
        
        <div id = "mixDough">
            <img src = "images/mix2.png">
            <img src = "images/mix1.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>Fill a small bowl with water &amp; a bit of oil &amp; set near your work station. You’ll wet your fingers with the mixture as you work to keep the dough from sticking to your hands.</p>
        <p>Take a golf ball-sized portion of dough &amp; roll into a ball, then poke into it with 3 fingers making a little cup. Make sure the thickness is even all the way around.</p>

        <div id = "formDough">
            <img src = "images/form1.png">
            <img src = "images/form2.png">
            <img src = "images/form3.png">
        </div>

        <p>Fill with AS MUCH CHEESE AS POSSIBLE! (I know it might look hard but it is crucial to put a lot of cheese or your pupusas will be dry with no filling. Another tip is to make your dough rounds bigger to fit more cheese. I've made small ones &amp; they were definitely NOT as good.) Remove excess dough from the top as needed &amp; then pat out the ball between your hands until flat. If the pupusa cracks, patch it with a bit of dough &amp; a little oil. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</p>

        <div id = "fillDough">
            <img src = "images/fill1.png">
            <img src = "images/fill2.png">
            <img src = "images/afterfill1.png">
            <img src = "images/afterfill2.png">
            <img src = "images/finalform1.png">
            <img src = "images/finalform2.png">
            <img src = "images/finalform3.png">
            <img src = "images/finalform4.png">
        </div>

        <p>Heat a large pan or griddle over medium heat. Brush with vegetable oil, then place 2-3 pupusas on the pan and cook for 2-4 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown. Flip &amp; cook on the other side for 2-4 minutes more, until golden brown &amp; warmed through. Repeat with the remaining pupusas.</p>

        <p>Serve the pupusas with salsa &amp; or curtido and enjoy! (I highly recommend making curtido, it is a spicy cabbage slaw &amp; very easy to make! There might even be a pre-made one somewhere! If you find it let me know!)</p>
